Tricky method: 1. Sort the list
	       2. Check whether the length of the list is larger than 2
	       3. Iterate the list from begining to the one before the last one:
		  a. if the consecutive item are the same skip to next one
		  b. define the left and right iterator, the left iterator is the one after 
		     the for loop iterator, the right iterator is the iterator of the last one  
                     of the list.
		  c. if the left iterator less than the right iterator:
			I. Sum the three items.
			II. if sum is less than 0: left iterator++
			III. if sum is larger than 0: right iterator--
			IV. else: if the consecutive items which left iterator points to are the 
					same, left iterator keeps ++, 
				  if the consecutive items which right iterator points to are the 
					same, right keeps iterator--,
				  left iterator++
				  right iterator--
		4. return list
